#Appcelerator Titanium Alloy Mobile - Parse Starter Template w/REST Service

This approach differs from the previous template in that we focus on using the [Parse REST API](https://www.parse.com/docs/rest) instead of the JavaScript API. The work is is [based on work done by Stephen Feather](https://gist.github.com/sfeather/4400387) and other on creating the initial gist that I have derived the parseREST service from. I have made additional updates to the parseREST service and will continue to make changes to the application to make for a better starter template as an alternative to Appcelerator Cloud Services
